# Google Search Page Replica

This project is a simple replica of the Google Search homepage, created using HTML and CSS. It includes features such as links to Google Image Search, Advanced Search, and the "I'm Feeling Lucky" button.

## Features

- **Google Search Interface:** The main search page has the classic Google search bar, buttons, and the logo, closely mimicking the design of the original Google homepage.
- **"I'm Feeling Lucky" Button:** Similar to the real Google search page, this button redirects users directly to a top search result.
- **Google Image Search:** A link is provided that redirects users to Google Image Search.
- **Advanced Search:** A link is provided to access Google's Advanced Search options.
